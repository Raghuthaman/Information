    <p> <li>CMS(Content Management system)We can create dynamic and responsive websites using CMS softwares without knowing to code.

You just need to get a domain name and web hosting and you should install the CMS software the most popular and common CMS software used by the developers is wordpress.

    <p><li>Website Builders: We can create dynamic and responsive websites using website builders too it is similar to a CMS software in which you don't need to code and create your website instead you can create your website with drag and drop method like the CMS softwares. The most popular and the best website builder in my opinion is Wix.Examples of Website Builders are Wix, Weebly and Squarespace.</li></p>
    
   <p><li>WYSIWYG Editors: WYSIWYG stands for “What You See Is What You Get”. As the name suggests, the WYSIWYG editor shows a live preview of your page as you add or modify elements. In addition, the code editor provides a visual interface that looks like a typical word processor.  

With a WYSIWYG editor, users can add web page elements, such as headings, paragraphs, or images without touching a line of code – making this type of HTML editor an excellent option for beginners with little to no coding experience. Examples of WYSIWYG editors are Adobe Dreamweaver CC, Froala and Coffeecup.</li></p>

   <p><li>Source Code Editors: In contrast to a WYSIWYG editor, a Source Code Editor is designed to enable more intricate coding practices. In addition, this type of HTML editor gives advanced users more control over their work as they can directly modify the code. 

Features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection are primarily available in this type of HTML editor. However, since there is no live preview of your page, it requires enough HTML knowledge to prevent errors. Examples of Source Code editors are Visual Studio Code(VSCode),  Sublime text and Brackets.</li></p>

   <p><li>Text Editors: Text Editors are programs in which you can create text documents as well as HTML documents.
   You can type HTML Code in normal text editors and create webpages but it is not used of bigger and complex    projects. If you are starting to learn HTML you can use text editors because they are very simple and you       won't get confused because in a proper HTML Source Code Editors there will be a lot of different things like    extensions for complex projects you may get confused with those extensions so while you are starting you can 
   start to create simple webpages in a normal text editor. Examples of text editors are Notepad and Wordpad.</li></p>
